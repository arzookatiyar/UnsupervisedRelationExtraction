291	At the Bonn Conference too, the agenda was to tackle and discuss the most urgent and indispensable factors concerning the life of humankind.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
292	The second feature was that both conferences ended without effective result, and the decisions taken and resolutions adopted there lacked conclusiveness and were not operational.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
293	As regards the recent conference (Bonn Meeting), although the past gatherings like the Hague meeting and Kyoto conference have proved to be failed experiences, nevertheless as the climatic and atmospheric crises are growing more serious, one can be optimistic and hopeful about the success of such protocols and pacts, and implementation of the agreements, even though they are not protected by any sanctions.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
294	It can safely be claimed that the events in Genoa have influenced [overshadowed] the very conferences in New York and Bonn; whereas, from the onset, the weak results of Genoa was foreseeable for most observers.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
295	The joint demand and stand by the majority of countries attending the conference was encountered by firm opposition by the United States [of America].	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
296	The Bonn Conference however, which dealt with the global environment and examined the condition of world climate, could be appraised as an exception and a relative success.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
297	Because, from the very start it could be predicted that on the subject of economic globalization, the developed and capitalist states were going to come across fierce opposition by dissident groups and the supporters of economic growth in poor countries.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
298	To recap, if there ever existed any possibility that at the conferences of New York and Genoa questions regarding: promotion of world security, improvement of economic conditions, defusing regional and global crises and conflicts, checking unleashed competition for rearmament, reduction of the gap between the mainstream and peripheral countries, and ... could be addressed and appropriate, serious, and worthy measures for their solution could be adopted, the opportunity was very easily lost and the meetings flopped completely.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
299	Regarding the American proposed Anti-Missile Defense System too, neither Russia, China, Japan, nor even the European Union, had shown any enthusiasm; rather they had all expressed their reserves on the project.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
300	After two weeks of discussion and exchange of views at the New York Conference, it was decided to pay heed to the resolute demands advanced by the majority of the participants, who emphatically insisted on the imposition of a ban on the sale of light weaponry.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800

302	The remarkable feature of this conference was the joint resolution adopted by 180 countries worldwide --- in regard to protection of environment, and above all reducing the emission of greenhouse gases ---, which has isolated America in an undeniable way.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
303	What, however, was most remarkable in the conferences in New York and Genoa, was the fact that most decisions made, were based on interests and tastes of particular groups [lobbies].	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
304	Concerning the environmental protection issue, the emission of toxic and greenhouse gases, and warming up of the planet earth's climate too, which was somehow related to the [agenda of] Bonn Conference, America had relentlessly demonstrated its paradoxical [as published] [controversial] position and particular stance opposed to that of other developed states by her previous abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
305	American delegates at the conference maintained that any restriction or ban on the sale, possession, and carrying of light armaments was practically the same as limiting the freedom of action [as published] of American citizens, and equal to reducing their margin of security.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
306	In the remarks made by these political leaders, one point is interesting and calls for reflection: if these leaders reject the interference of others in the condition and destiny of the poor nations, while present themselves legitimate and competent to make far reaching decisions for them, then it must be said that they are only the elected [leaders] of their own nation [people], and this does not entitle them to act as representative or legal attorney of all people worldwide!	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
307	[Sentences are as published] The most important of the three conferences, which subsequently gained even more prominence, was the conference in Genova; perhaps even more so for the results "not obtained" at the conference, and which led to the subsequent intense dissatisfaction and frustration of the leading industrial states attending the meeting.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800

309	The governments attending the conference had a long and varied agenda, including: economic globalization, the anti-missile shield defense project, the Kyoto Protocol and environmental protection, the political and military crises in the Middle East, the Balkans, and Afghanistan, moratorium on the accumulated debt of the poor countries, and ... [as published] They meant to reach some form of agreement or understanding about those issues, but unexpected events left all that in limbo and uncertainty.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
310	Jacques Chirac, the French President, responding to the protests leveled by opponents of globalization, had said: "They have no right to present themselves as defenders of the world poor..."	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
311	During the past weeks Europe and America witnessed the arrangement of important international conferences, which could on the one hand guarantee the peace and stability of the world, or could instead deteriorate the conditions.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
312	But paying heed was not tantamount to endorsement of the demand launched by those countries; rather, the final result came out as a compromise solution and a relative back up by the majority group.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
313	Similarly, Gerhard Schroeder, the German Chancellor, too had claimed that the participants at the summit meeting were the true, legitimate, and elected representatives of the people of their countries.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800

315	It was due to this isolation that America, in spite of discrediting [undermining] the Kyoto Protocol and declining to comply with the Bonn Conference [resolution], was forced to at least make a promise to cooperate in preventing an increase in air pollution.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800

319	The conference in New York, which dealt with a ban on demand for light arms, and the Genoa Conference which had a much wider and extended agenda, had two common features between them.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800
320	The first was that large and numerous bodies of dissidents were opposing the wishes and interests of a small but powerful group.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20010907/00.16.28-8800

826	The core of the matter lies in a just and acceptable political framework that Israel is supposed to approve and participate in to put a final end to the occupation and to the settlement construction activities.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20011107/15.37.27-28157
827	It is not implementing an immediate and total withdrawal -- as demanded by the international community as a whole and the United States in particular -- but a phased and partial withdrawal.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20011107/15.37.27-28157
828	Such a political framework would lay the firm foundations for a comprehensive peace based on justice and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20011107/15.37.27-28157
829	The inevitable result of this tactic -- if it succeeds in temporarily calming down the situation -- is that it will take back conditions to their former state of tension after the withdrawals are completed from all the Palestinian cities.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20011107/15.37.27-28157
830	This being the case, it would be better for both Israel and the Palestinians to have an immediate and parallel Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied parts of several Palestinian cities.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20011107/15.37.27-28157
831	Israel says that it carried out this tactic in Bethlehem and Bayt Jala, or so it claims, and yesterday, it claimed that it carried out the same tactic in Qalqiliyah when the Palestinian security forces returned to the three centers that had been re-occupied by the invading Israeli forces.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20011107/15.37.27-28157

836	Israel seems to think that this tactic will circumvent the Palestinian move toward independence and will put an end to the Palestinian intifadah by surrounding the areas of tension and dealing with them separately.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20011107/15.37.27-28157

968	In terms of market, the Mexican exports do not play an important role, but the support for OPEC on the part of Mexico, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia in 1998 and 1999 lent credibility to the policy of cutbacks, and achieved the recovery of prices.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20011112/20.33.31-29984

973	Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens has admitted that it is unfeasible to guarantee the flow of revenues to the government if the Finance Secretariat maintains its estimate that the crude export platform in 2002 will average 1.825 million barrels per day, at a price of $17.00 per barrel.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20011112/20.33.31-29984

975	Nevertheless, according to the researcher from the UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico] Economics Department, Angel de la Vega, since the Fox administration does not have the security of a fiscal reform available, it cannot be ruled out that Mexico might collaborate with OPEC in the event of a more serious reduction in oil prices.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20011112/20.33.31-29984

984	He emphasized: "Now Mexico is positioned between two fronts: it recognizes the need for reducing the supply on the market, but the policy is to support the United States and supply it with more crude if it should become necessary."	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20011112/20.33.31-29984

986	He noted that the Mexican economy is very closely linked to that of the United States, and hence no oil producer, whether a member of OPEC or not, is in such a disadvantageous situation.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20011112/20.33.31-29984

2337	Brussels -- This week, the Second Chamber will initiate the debate on euthanasia.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020109/21.17.18-25137
2338	However, SP.A [Dutch-speaking Socialist Party - Different] Deputy Fred Erdman has drafted his own bill "regarding the problems connected with terminating one's life and the condition of terminally ill patients." VLD Floor Leader Hugo Coveliers and party member Maggie De Block also have a bill on euthanasia.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020109/21.17.18-25137
2339	Ever since then, the Senate's work has been subject to increasing criticisms, including from groups that support a possible law on euthanasia.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020109/21.17.18-25137
2340	The Chamber apparently wants to push ahead with the debate on euthanasia because available speaking time is very limited.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020109/21.17.18-25137
2341	The criticisms mainly focus on the applicability of the Senate's bill, the lack of a palliative filter prior to committing euthanasia, the supervisory role of the assessment committee, which is likely to be understaffed, and the nonexistence of fixed penalties for unjustifiable cases of euthanasia.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020109/21.17.18-25137

2343	Moreover, the Chamber's justice committee seems to want to go it alone regarding the euthanasia debate.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020109/21.17.18-25137
2344	According to the CD&amp;amp;V [Christian Democratic and Flemish], this is why this committee has only been given an advisory function.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020109/21.17.18-25137

2349	But it was the uncertainty with which her rival, Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber of the Christian Social Union, the CDU's Bavarian sister party, also shrouded himself that made the question of who would lead the Union parties into the 22 September elections as chancellor candidate against incumbent Gerhard Schroeder, so exciting.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729
2350	Mr. Stoiber seized it once the CDU made clear that it preferred him to its own chairwoman.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729
2351	Mr. Stoiber has come a long way from his refusal to sacrifice himself for the CDU in an election that once looked impossible to win, through his statement that he would under no circumstances run against the wishes of Ms. Merkel and her party, to his willingness to take her on in a divisive vote if necessary.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729
2352	The CDU chose him because it believes in victory.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729
2353	Mr. Stoiber carefully tread the path to the candidacy, spurred on by many and reined in by others	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729
2354	Rather than force himself on the CDU, he waited to be called.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729
2355	If anyone in their ranks can turn this to their advantage, it is Mr. Stoiber.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729
2356	That has always been the basic premise for a CSU chairman to accept the candidacy on behalf of the bigger sister party.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729
2357	Nor will Mr. Stoiber have any illusions of what it means to lead an election campaign, although he can be confident in the knowledge that what is at stake is not Edmund Stoiber, nor the Union, but Germany as a whole.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729

2359	The most cogent argument in Mr. Stoiber's favor is that he will be running as a hopeful and not as the ticket of last resort.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729
2360	That Angela Merkel, the chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Union, wanted the job had long been an open secret, although no one but she knew how far she was prepared to go.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729
2361	Having marginalized their own leader, the CDU grandees cannot afford to leave the chancellor candidate in the lurch as well.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729
2362	But he let slip the opportunities to turn back, because the forces that drive him -- his desire to affect change, his sense of duty to his peers and his ambition -- would not permit him to pass up the biggest chance of his political life.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729
2363	It does not, of course, guarantee success at the polls -- or even solidarity in the campaign.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.00.52-4729
2364	In these covenants, the companies pledge to rank among the world leaders in energy efficiency by 2012.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2365	Following the formal ratification of the Kyoto protocol by all the parliaments of the concerned countries, that protocol will become equivalent to a Belgian law.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2366	But it is highly unclear whether these measures will lead to many extra reductions of emissions in comparison with the business as usual scenario without additional policy efforts.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2367	If it were to emerge from the comparison with domestic and foreign companies that certain companies do not rank among the world leaders in energy efficiency, they would have to present a plan to achieve the highest energy efficiency on time (by 2012).	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2368	Hence a broad social debate on who should contribute how much to realizing the Kyoto standards is urgently necessary.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2369	Thus the benchmark covenants could be reconciled with the European Commission's recent proposals for launching a unified market for European carbon dioxide emissions by 2005.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2370	We readily accept that there are good intentions on the part of both the government and this country's various sectors to comply with the Kyoto standards.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2371	However, no broad social debate has yet been conducted on the crucial question: How much should each sector or target group contribute to achieving the Belgian Kyoto standard?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2372	Companies are urged in the proposed covenants to adopt measures which have an economic cost recovery period of less than five years or have an internal rate of return greater than that of a straight-lined obligation.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2373	Within the framework of that protocol, Belgium must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5 percent, compared to 1990, in the 2008-2012 period.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2374	However, taking into account these external climate costs is essential, because the users of energy-intensive goods are confronted in that way with the consequences of their choice of product.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2375	To begin with, the principle of benchmarking itself raises questions.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2376	Fourth is the contrast between the benchmark covenants' relative emissions standards and the Belgian Government's absolute restrictions on emissions within the framework of the Kyoto protocol.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2377	This European proposal assumes absolute restrictions on emissions (companies obtain rights to emit a certain number of tons of carbon dioxide) and is hence irreconcilable at first sight with the Flemish benchmark covenants.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2378	A cost-efficient division of efforts implies that each sector must limit its emissions to the point at which the additional costs for one extra ton of reduction are the same in all sectors.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2379	According to industry, relocation, with the resulting job losses, would be the only solution.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2380	But benchmarking is not sufficient from the viewpoint of economic efficiency (realizing the Kyoto restrictions on emissions at the lowest possible costs for the whole of society).	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2381	This implies -- whether or not one agrees with it -- that the Kyoto protocol will become binding for all of this country's inhabitants and institutions.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2382	In return for their commitment, they are exempted from additional (Flemish) emission restrictions, taxes on emissions, or negotiable emission rights.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2383	Belgian industry is advocating benchmark covenants because it is afraid that an absolute limit would weaken considerably its competitive position with respect to similar companies in regions where the Kyoto protocol is not ratified.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2384	The great advantage of negotiable emission rights in that the system can lead to a cost-efficient division of effort among all sectors and target groups.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2385	Companies could be allocated rights on the basis of an energy efficiency standard, on the condition that they are prepared to accept an absolute emissions ceiling.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2386	Since industry does not wish to let itself be pinned down on an absolute emissions ceiling, while the government feels itself committed to an absolute ceiling, industry is foisting the necessary efforts onto other sectors in society through the benchmark covenants.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2387	However, the benchmark covenants could be opportune here for settling the initial allocation of emission rights.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2388	However, this disregards the fact that arguments other than purely financial ones also play a part in the location decisions of companies in our region (favorable location near seaports, availability of know-how, well-educated personnel, stable political climate...).	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2389	That is strikingly illustrated by Belgian large-scale industry, which has made great efforts over the past 10 years, over which energy intensity (energy use per unit of final product) has improved considerably.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2390	In a nutshell, benchmarking means that companies compare their energy efficiency with that of similar plants abroad.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2391	By using the benchmark covenants to allocate emission rights initially, the good points of covenants are retained and their drawbacks are eliminated.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2392	Thus the benchmark covenants could have very significant consequences for other sectors and target groups in our society, whereas the latter are not involved in the deliberations on those covenants.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2393	The federal and local authorities are currently preparing the ratification of the Kyoto international protocol on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2394	If industrial greenhouse gas emissions increase considerably over the next 10 years, that will have to be offset by a commensurate reduction of emissions in the transport sector, services, households, and so forth.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2395	Large-scale industry wishes to counter the expected rise with so-called benchmark covenants.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2396	In that way, less energy-intensive products enjoy a relative advantage.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2397	Despite these shortcomings, we believe that a role is reserved for the instrument of benchmark covenants.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2398	As a result, the costs of additional restrictions on emissions in industry must be compared with those of other sectors, such as the transport sector, households, the service sector, and so forth.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2399	Third, questions can be asked about the emission restrictions that would be achieved by the covenants.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2400	Second, benchmark covenants do not guarantee that the external climate costs of energy use (the increased greenhouse effect caused by the burning of fossil fuels) are correctly taken into account in the final products of the sectors concerned.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2401	Benchmarking guarantees only that companies belong to the top of their class, but says nothing about that class's performance as compared with the whole universe.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2402	Only a division that takes account of every sector's possibilities and is borne by the various target groups guarantees that Belgium will achieve its Kyoto aims without draconian measures having to be adopted at the eleventh hour.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2403	In any case, it is high time that a social debate be organized on the division of effort to achieve the Kyoto aims.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2404	But a very considerable increase in production is expected in Belgium over the next 10 years, so that (even with very efficient processes) overall carbon dioxide emissions will certainly rise.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2405	Those covenants contain insufficient guarantees in themselves to achieve the Belgian/Flemish reduction targets in an economically efficient manner.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2406	Because this debate has failed to take place, it is understandable that all sectors (ranging from processing and manufacturing industrial sector, the electricity sector, the tertiary sector, and the transport sector to the residential sector) are currently doing their utmost to make their own future efforts as small (yet acceptable) as possible.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601
2407	However, if they wish to emit more (because, for instance, their output is increasing considerably), they can do so provided that they purchase the necessary emission rights from companies which have a surplus of rights.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020111/21.05.06-7601

2710	The upgrading and especially the last part - the boosting unit - have made it possible "to surge on the foreign market" and provided for a great economic and commercial effect from the launch of an upgraded Proton rocket-booster, said Medvedev.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020121/21.31.10-15710

2712	According to Koptev, such interaction with Europe would make it possible for six spacemen to be on board the ISS rather than the current three, as well as to use a Russian Soyuz rocket as a rescue spaceship.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020121/21.31.10-15710
2713	The centre's chief, Aleksandr Medvedev, reported to the president about the development of Russia's segment on board the International Space Station [ISS].	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020121/21.31.10-15710

2715	Koptev explained that the USA has suspended the ISS development programme until a deficit of 4.7bn dollars is paid off.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020121/21.31.10-15710
2716	According to Medvedev, the main upgrading work included "the replacement of the control system, improvement of design data, the determination of ecological measures at the first stage, and the improvement of the rocket-booster at the boosting unit's expense."	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020121/21.31.10-15710
2717	The director-general of the Khrunichev centre briefed the head of state on how the heavy Proton rocket-booster had been upgraded.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020121/21.31.10-15710
2718	According to the director, it is this rocket booster that launches almost all of Russia's military and civilian satellites into space.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020121/21.31.10-15710
2719	In all, since the first launch of Proton in 1965, according to Medvedev, 284 launches of this rocket have been made, all from the Baykonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020121/21.31.10-15710

2722	As such they face the prospect of being subjected to the due course of law and in the final analysis perhaps sentenced to death in closed military courts instead of in open courts, as is the right of prisoners of war under the terms of the Geneva Convention.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020122/20.31.55-8089
2723	And for this reason, too, they have a moral duty to speak out, as Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh, among others, did yesterday.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020122/20.31.55-8089
2724	In an antiterrorist war that at the time was initially launched as Operation Infinite Justice, it is infinitely difficult to reconcile oneself to the pictures of chained and humiliated Taliban and al-Qaida prisoners at the U.S. Guantanamo base on Cuba.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020122/20.31.55-8089
2725	The pictures resemble an attempt to satisfy a primitive thirst for revenge and convince the Americans that the Bush administration has not only succeeded in removing a regime of religious madmen in out-of-the-way Afghanistan, but also in taking prisoner some of those responsible for the terrorist acts on that day in September.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020122/20.31.55-8089
2726	With its behavior, therefore, the United States is not only compromising the image of the war against terrorism as an expression of a higher form of justice, but also of itself as an unshakeable defender of this same justice.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020122/20.31.55-8089
2727	Many of them have already demonstrated great skill in their own behavior when it comes to exploiting the West's fear of terrorism.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020122/20.31.55-8089
2728	The U.S. and most recently the British governments reject the suggestion that the prisoners are being harmed, but this does not alter the fact that the pictures of hooded prisoners in chains are in themselves enough to paint a picture of a United States that in the name of self-righteousness - and equally worryingly: without any great amount of debate - has allowed itself to infringe international rules.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020122/20.31.55-8089
2729	This will undoubtedly rub off on the superpower's allies, including Denmark.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020122/20.31.55-8089
2730	Otherwise they face the risk not only of undermining the legitimacy of their own antiterrorism war at present, but also of sending out a signal that despots around the world will know how to exploit.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020122/20.31.55-8089
2731	For most people it will of course be difficult to mobilize any great degree of understanding for those responsible for the bloody terrorism in the United States on that day in September, but what is at issue here is that at the present moment principles are at stake that could have far-reaching repercussions for the future war against terrorism.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020122/20.31.55-8089
2732	Instead the superpower has entered a legal fog where the prisoners have been stamped with a nonsense term in international law: "battlefield prisoners."	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020122/20.31.55-8089
2733	This impression is reinforced by the fact that for the time being at least the United States has ignored the Geneva Convention and refused to treat those taken prisoner as prisoners of war - something to which they have a right - until a competent court has decided differently.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020122/20.31.55-8089

3162	Indeed, American foreign policy towards the Arab and Muslim worlds was not much better before Sept. 11, but since then tactful political manoeuvring has given way to forthright disregard for the Arab viewpoint.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020130/20.43.33-11456

3172	Soon after the World Trade Centre attacks, we started to witness the beginning of a concerted effort by the Bush administration and the media to cast Arabs and Muslims as the new enemy of America.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020130/20.43.33-11456

3183	However, I believe it is more than that.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3184	And, most of all -- this is a very important detail in this case -- the Convention forces the country that holds prisoners of war to release them immediately when the conflict is over.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3185	According to interpretations on which the individual in question refused to comment, Condoleezza Rice, the US President's national security adviser, played an important role in supporting Powell's opinion.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3186	Eventually, making a sum of the proposals offered by his main advisers, President Bush admitted on Monday, following the National Security Council meeting, that the captives at Guantanamo Bay will be covered under the "spirit of the Geneva Convention," even if their special status comes from the fact that they will continue to be designated terrorists, rather than prisoners of war.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3187	Following his recent world tours, Powell suggested that the President accept the validity of the Geneva Convention for the pro-Taliban detainees.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3188	In all likelihood, President Bush made that statement on 18 January following a consultation -- which was "rather brief," some US observers believe -- with Ashcroft, who was strongly supported by Cheney.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3189	Sometimes the criticism was unexpectedly tough: Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said "the US Government cannot choose to wage war in Afghanistan with guns, bombs and soldiers, and then assert the laws of war do not apply."	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3190	The fact that the President reconsidered his own statement of 18 January led to diverse reactions.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3191	In other words, he admitted he had been wrong -- and that at time when opinion polls in the United States are, without exception, very favorable to him.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3192	Therefore, even if Powell agrees with the refusal to grant prisoner-of-war status to the 158 captives, he believe that the US refusal to cover the captives under the Geneva Convention would set a precedent that could affect the fate of US soldiers sent out to risky areas of this planet.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3193	Therefore, the dispute of opinions in the administration became a lesson in applied democracy.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3194	In this concern about details -- about cold-blood accomplices to murder, because that is what these al-Qa'ida disciples at Guantanamo Bay are -- the US Administration proves it is capable of admitting it is not infallible, which is the equivalent of respect for democracy.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3195	And, as a last detail, let us remember that, harassed everywhere by journalists and commentators, no US leader ever thought of finding "monkeys" [reference to a statement made by Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase] among media workers or scapegoats among the weirdoes who use hundreds of websites to call on the administration to stop supporting the Jews or to exterminate the Arabs.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3196	As for their possible repatriation, it cannot be taken into consideration, as long as the war against terrorism is far from over.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3197	The United States wanted this very much, because so far the identity and citizenship of those they call "terrorists" (or "killers" in Bush's languages without nuances) rather than prisoners in a conventional war have not been published for reasons that are easy to understand.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3198	There is irony -- including from the sober The New York Times , which wrote in its Tuesday issue that in his Monday speech the President "twice called the 158 pro-Taliban fighters 'prisoners,' then stopped himself, and used the word 'detainees.'"	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3199	This is about the following: on 18 January 2002, President Bush publicly announced two decisions, which, owing to the President's firmness in announcing them, seemed unyielding: first, the President said the 158 pro-Taliban fighters brought to Guantanamo Bay were not defined by US courts as prisoners of war; therefore, the United States does not believe it is its duty to grant them prisoner-of-war rights under the Geneva Convention, which regulates (since 1949) the status of this category of detained combatants.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3200	President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell also participated in this business.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3201	Obviously, this decision simplified things, and it allowed the US judiciary to conduct the investigation of the 158 detainees as it sees fit.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3202	The issue at stake was apparently simple: the status of the detainees, members of al-Qa'ida and Taliban fighters captured by US troops in Afghanistan in recent months and recently transferred to a detention base at Guantanamo Bay.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3203	In a first phase, the rest of the administration was baffled by Powell's opinion, but shortly afterward Rumsfeld sided with him, supporting his proposal in front of the President.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3204	These were some of the leaders called to express their opinions: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Vice President Dick Cheney, John Ashcroft (general prosecutor and chief of the Justice Department), CIA Director George Tenet, General Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3205	Saudi Arabia alone says "more than 100" of the 158 are Saudi citizens (a figure the Americans see as exaggerated), and Saudi Interior Minister Prince Saud Nayif recently said that his country would like to have them repatriated, to be tried at home.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3206	The surprise -- for the US administration and the US media -- came with a statement made by Powell.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3207	According to information circulated by the main US newspapers, the detainees are citizens of 25 countries, including England, France, Australia, Yemen, Algeria, and even Sweden (!).	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3208	At first sight, this seems to be nothing more than a terminology issue.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3209	Eventually, President Bush agreed to reconsider some of the decisions he had announced a short time previously.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3210	In the actual situation we are discussing, the issue is the privileges ensured by the Convention: according to that act, no detained combatant can be forced to reveal to the interrogator anything other than his name, rank, military serial number, and birth date.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3211	On Monday 28 January, the US National Security Council convened for an uncomfortable meeting; the main issue to be debated was known as early as the week before, following an unprecedented split that had emerged in the US Administration.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3212	According to his own assertions, the obvious concern of some Western European leaders -- US allies -- and of some important European governmental and non-governmental institutions about the treatment the detainees are being subjected to, especially following the publication of certain images of the Guantanamo Bay camp that could be interpreted in various ways, played a key role in this position.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.50.32-16604
3213	President Mugabe would also soon be inviting all political parties, chiefs, churches, war veterans, media houses and civic organisations to a meeting on charting a peaceful way forward by finding ways of curtailing the incidents of violence.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.58.51-26741
3214	Soon after the meeting, the ministers said Sadc would not accept or participate in any form of sanctions on Zimbabwe by the EU or Commonwealth.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.58.51-26741

3216	In his opening address to a Southern Africa Development Community land task force on Zimbabwe, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Cde Stan Mudenge, said Zimbabwe was tired of being dictated to by the EU and the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group instead of being engaged in dialogue.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.58.51-26741

3219	President Mugabe on Monday said the Sadc was among the groups he had invited to send observers to the polls.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.58.51-26741
3220	Cde Mudenge said the judiciary had remained free as shown by two cases, which were won by opposition MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai and the Combined Harare Residents Association.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.58.51-26741
3221	"Too much blood was shed and much suffering endured to achieve our independence and regain our sovereignty for anyone to imagine that they can either dictate or intimidate us into submission," said Cde Mudenge.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.58.51-26741
3222	The decision to send the observers was reached in Harare after a one-day meeting of the forum last week, Mpasu said.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.58.51-26741

3227	"Members of the Ministerial Committee will be fully briefed on the actions that are being taken to deal with the problem of violence which has taken place in some parts of the country," said Cde Mudenge.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.58.51-26741
3228	Instead, they have issued ultimatums and some of the countries have imposed unofficial sanctions, which stood in the way of honest negotiations.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.58.51-26741
3229	Meanwhile, the Sadc forum said yesterday that it will send at least 39 observers to Zimbabwe a month before the Presidential election.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.58.51-26741

3231	Cde Mudenge told the meeting that while Zimbabwe was addressing issues being raised by the two organisations, the two had not done anything to address issues raised by Zimbabwe.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.58.51-26741

3233	The taskforce was also of the view that the international media should be allowed to cover the country's Presidential election, an issue, which has already been resolved by Government.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020131/20.58.51-26741

5580	Apparently not in Monterrey, where Bush will have a full agenda, and without contacts with other chief executives, except for Mexico's President Vicente Fox, and Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien, since they are trading partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.41.36-1407

5583	Then what?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.41.36-1407
5584	According to some sources, the crisis is in a bind: the IMF is asking for more belt-tightening, and the government is asking for more money.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.41.36-1407

5587	A source from the United Nations observed ironically: "If Chile were Iraq, and if President Ricardo Lagos were Saddam Hussein, Argentina would have Bush's full support."

5588	The source commented: "Argentine is in a position to be an alternative reference point for the United States, to the detriment of Brazil which, in view of the internal and external vicissitudes facing Fernando Henrique Cardoso, is, day by day, becoming somewhat weak."	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.41.36-1407

5591	With a strategy that would permit Duhalde, if he does not receive a clear signal from the IMF, not to call for elections in 90 days, for example, and to become a lame duck, waiting for his successor, he explained.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.41.36-1407
5592	It is common knowledge, among most of the small groups, that the Argentine crisis is more political than economic, and that, as one Latin American diplomat accredited to the UN remarked, the formula in question does not hold much mystery: "A rapprochement with the United States is indispensable, because it is the only one that can extricate them from this."	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.41.36-1407

5597	Monterrey, Mexico--Choked, hushed voices, some of them astounded, are not guessing correctly about the dilemma of the chicken or the egg into which the Argentine crisis has become converted, almost grotesquely: will the International Monetary Fund (IMF) endorse concrete aid to the country, apart from the presumable good intentions of its board members and technicians, without the approval of George W. Bush?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.41.36-1407
5598	In that document, the Monterrey Consensus, free trade, the amendment on the distortion with agricultural subsidies, and the treatment of the external debt as fundamental pivotal points, benefit Argentina.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.41.36-1407

5601	The entire world -- not the Palestinians alone -- is waiting to hear an official Israeli statement regarding its recognition of the Palestinian national rights and its readiness to withdraw from all lands occupied in 1967, put an end to the settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza, and support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state de facto.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.49.47-8044
5602	Some Israeli officials, particularly Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, have stated that the success or failure of US envoy Zinni's mission hinges on the Palestinians only because they might carry out a suicide or shooting attack that will make Israel retaliate, thus bringing the region back to the cycle of violence.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.49.47-8044
5603	Such a statement will actually constitute the beginning of a real era of peace and the end of the era of violence and counterviolence.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.49.47-8044
5604	Such an Israeli statement would not only serve Zinni's mission but would also accelerate the attainment of a permanent arrangement in which Israel would gain peace and security in exchange for its withdrawal from the Palestinian lands, the end of its colonialist occupation, and the renunciation of its mentality of domination and expansion, which have caused calamities and catastrophes in the past five decades.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.49.47-8044
5605	Clearly, the Palestinian side has acceded to all demands -- even more than that -- when it recognized Israel's right to exist on 78 percent of historical Palestine.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.49.47-8044
5606	The coming days and weeks will show whether Israel is actually ready to positively and objectively deal with the Palestinian national rights without trying to maneuver, place obstacles, or set impossible conditions during Zinni's mission.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.49.47-8044
5607	In any case, Zinni's mission is to make sure that certain measures are adopted as soon as possible to pave the road to a political settlement of the Palestinian question.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.49.47-8044
5608	Consequently, Zinni will find it difficult to attain a cease-fire and commence the implementation of the Tenet understandings and Mitchell recommendations.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.49.47-8044
5609	This allegation contradicts the simplest fact on the ground, as Israel is the one that occupies most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Israel is the one that possesses vast military power which it uses to make incursions into and raid Palestinian cities and refugee camps; to intimidate women and children; to assassinate innocent activists and citizens; to destroy buildings, facilities, infrastructure, roads, water pipes, and electricity and telephone poles; to attack Palestinian ambulances and kill medical teams; and to carry out other retaliatory, suppressive, and devastating practices.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.49.47-8044
5610	It cannot make more concessions.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.49.47-8044
5611	Israel's compliance with the required commitments will be the real test not only of its readiness to facilitate the US envoy's mission but also its readiness to establish a just peace which is in the interest of all parties concerned.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.49.47-8044
5612	Thus roles were distributed specifically and clearly, and each role was drawn accurately and with care, exactly as was the case in the great movie "The Second Wife" between the tyrannical mayor with power, Abu-al-Ila, the simple peasant who owns nothing but the clothes on his back and a gang of children, and his wife, who was coveted by the mayor.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.52.35-10118
5613	Therefore, the United States endeavors hard to save Israel from the serious crisis that Sharon has put himself into.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.52.35-10118
5614	Then you find a dramatic portrayal of the reversed situation in which the Shaykh, or in this case the "US," Anthony Zinni, advises Abu-al-Ila, "Palestinian," to bow and accept the mayor's, "Israel's," demands, or else he would be convicted of possessing weapons of destruction in the eyes of the authorities.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.52.35-10118
5615	Thus, after the US mass media and newspapers revealed the report by the Pentagon that listed seven countries to be attacked with US atomic weapons in case US national security was threatened, it became clear that the United States develops and produces weapons of mass destruction to threaten the stability and security of the world, and that it violates the United Nations Charter attacking independent and sovereign nations.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.52.35-10118
5616	Immediately a neutral intermediate appears, represented in the fake imposter Shaykh, who is the friend of the mayor in the axis of evil.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.52.35-10118
5617	Namely that the countries of the axis of evil, from his point of view, are those that produce, develop, and amass weapons of mass destruction in a way that threatens the security and stability of its neighbors, as well as all the countries in the world.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.52.35-10118
5618	We can review, for example, the voting results in the Security Council to see how Washington always defends Israel, then how Britain always justifies the stances by both countries in admirable harmony.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.52.35-10118
5619	The countries of the US axis are similar, for they cooperate, are joined by a strategic bond, and each defends the other and supports it with words and deeds.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.52.35-10118
5620	Of course the second side in the US axis is Israel, and definitely the third side will go to no one but Britain, as it conforms to the same criteria and because it completely supports the US stance and considers it the absolute right in all cases.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.52.35-10118
5621	So now we only wait for the advice of Haj Zinni to obey those in authority, so that we would not become terrorists like Iraq, North Korea, and Iran!	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.52.35-10118
5622	It has now become our right to announce clearly that the United States had become one of the sides of the axis of evil according to the same criteria set by the United States itself, and declared by its President George Bush.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.52.35-10118

5627	Yu Keli, deputy director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences [CASS], said that since taking office, the Bush administration has gone farther and farther in "interfering in China's internal affairs and meddling in the Taiwan issue" and has entirely run counter to the aspirations of the two peoples for the healthy development of Sino-US relations.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.58.59-16532

5630	Li Jiaquan, research fellow at the CASS Institute of Taiwan Studies, said: During his visit to China, Bush steered clear of the Sino-US three joint communiques and one China on two important occasions, his joint conference with Jiang Zemin and his speech at Qinghua University.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/20020320/11.58.59-16532

7234	All other countries which are seemingly  refraining from acquiring such weapons are doing so not so much  to escape being branded as "evil" but rather because they have  neither the knowledge nor the money to join the "nuclear club".	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/non_fbis/06.12.31-26764

8443	And  while American prisoners in the Hanoi Hilton often spent years  in solitary confinement and received no medical care (John  McCain to this day can't comb his own hair), X-Ray detainees get  daily sick calls from all manner of doctors, from optometrists  to podiatrists.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/non_fbis/08.46.28-13637

8449	Though these seemed perfectly reasonable precautions to  take when transporting by C-141 members of an organization  already responsible for one prison uprising (Mazar-i-Sharif,  which resulted in a CIA operative's death) and several suicide  plane crashes, human rights groups and international media, led  by a chorus of Euro-whiners, immediately lapsed into hysterics.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/non_fbis/08.46.28-13637

10655	"These two reports seemed to indicate that the Bush administration took China's rising military threat more seriously than did the Clinton's administration.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/temp_fbis/21.07.24-28603

11239	When you and I       help somebody find a job, one more person joins the ranks of tax payers,       fewer tax dollars are spent on public assistance and businesses gain       another consumer.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL070
11240	Goodwill has devised       the programs that turned your investment into results.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL070
11241	We've found ways       for people with disabilities to enter the workforce.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL070
11242	We've helped people break free of the welfare cycle.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL070
11243	There are a lot of barriers that keep people from working: physical       and mental disabilities, history of welfare dependency and lack of       education or self-esteem.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL070
11244	You have helped make       Goodwill's work possible with your previous support.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL070

11246	Michael was born with cerebral palsy.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11247	For several years he performed packaging and clerical work.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11248	For 18 long months Michael could not find a job.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11249	Now his goals       are set on moving up in the company.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11250	Their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than three-quarters of       a million dollars in public assistance.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11251	He resorted to public       assistance dollars to survive.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11252	November 15, 1994       Dear ,       Think of your greatest accomplishments.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11253	Upon entering the work force, he       discovered few job opportunities that seemed to match his abilities.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11254	Michael Sims felt that way at age 39 -- the day he earned a job.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11255	Think of the joy and success       they bring to you and your loved ones.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11256	The savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents, however.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11257	Like Michael, they       share two common characteristics.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11258	Individual successes at Goodwill mean fewer persons receiving public       support and more paying taxes.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11259	For every dollar of public       support Goodwill received last year, we returned $1.59 to the community       in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11260	As the Clubhouse Monitor at Bent Tree Apartments, he now       provides customer service for 50 to 60 tenants each night.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11261	After three interviews, Michael proved that he was the right person       for the job.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11262	His most       recent job lasted only a year before cut-backs eliminated his       position.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11263	They face some barrier to employment       and they want to work.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11264	Won't you help make all of these successes possible?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11265	The families of the new wage earners may feel the accomplishment in terms       of a house to live in, money to purchase food -- without food stamps --       and the beginning of a family focused on success, not hopelessness.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11266	At last, he has found success in a job that he loves.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11267	At Goodwill, Michael's counselors felt that his personable demeanor       could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible job-match       where his people skills could shine.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11268	Finally, Michael called Goodwill.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11269	Every year, thousands of people come to Goodwill.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11270	Please send the       largest contribution you can comfortably make.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11271	Sincerely,       James M. McClelland President       P.S. Your gift will make a difference.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11272	Last year, participants in Goodwill       programs earned --and paid taxes on -- wages of nearly $3.5 million.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11273	Your gift will help give       new meaning to the word success -- for people who have seldom had reason       to use the word.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11274	And then       the pay-off begins for the entire community.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL071
11275	We need your support to       continue getting people off of public assistance.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL072
11276	Their complaint: the system discourages working because unemployment       provides benefits that many entry-level jobs don't include.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL072
11277	That's where you --and Goodwill --come in.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL072
11278	Right now.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL072
11279	And welfare reform is an uncertain solution       with an unknown starting date.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL072
11280	Welfare is not the answer.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL072
11281	While the debate on welfare reform is gathering like a storm at sea,       the people who need jobs are floundering.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL072
11282	Last       year, Goodwill placed 511 people in jobs, more than double the number we       placed in 1993.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL072
11283	Please give the largest gift you can to Goodwill today.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL072
11284	We help people train for       and find jobs that make it possible for them to get off of welfare.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL072
11285	Sincerely,       Jack Dustman Chairman	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL072
11286	Some of the strongest critics of our welfare system are the people who       have become dependent on it.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL072
11287	Goodwill works.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL072
11288	Please make an investment in the stability of our community by sending       a gift to Goodwill.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11289	March 17, 2000       Name Address City, ST, Zip       Dear Name:       When Jerry was released from prison, he knew it would take hard work       and determination to straighten out his life.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11290	For as long as he needs it, Goodwill       will continue to help.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11291	More than 100 were homeless.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200

11293	But Goodwill offers hope even to people with numerous obstacles to       overcome, like Jerry.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11294	Of the       more than 42,000 people Goodwill served in 1999, over 5,000 of them have       multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11295	Your generosity will help people help themselves.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11296	Some are blind, deaf or have other physical disabilities.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11297	The Trustee referred him       to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill's Career Academy staff       for job search assistance.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11298	Reality hit when he was unable to reconcile with his wife and ended up       on the street.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11299	And, with your assistance, Goodwill can help employers       develop resources to keep workers on the job.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11300	He knew he had made a bad       mistake, but despite his commitment to rebuilding his life, he just       didn't count on the obstacles that would be thrown up in his path.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11301	Jerry's Goodwill caseworker found him a job immediately.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11302	With a promising new job at a plastic injection       molding manufacturer, his legal troubles in check and a safe place to       live, Jerry can get on with the business of building a life for himself       and contributing to his community.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11303	The seasonal construction job he obtained soon       ended, and he returned to Career Academy for help once more.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200
11304	But Jerry's       troubles didn't end there.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200

11308	It took some time and hard work, but with the help of Goodwill, Jerry       was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor's office, find       housing and conduct a more thorough job search.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/110CYL200

11313	Because Pleasant Run is the only "family" for so many, our       Emancipation Fund is one way we can help a young person take the first       steps into his or her new life as an independent and productive       adult.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/112C-L012

11611	We believe there       is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative       effort to financially support the services MCCOY offers to the community       as a whole.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/116CUL034
11612	For the past three years, MCCOY has been actively engaged in       accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others:       youth service providers, youth, funding bodies, and interested citizens       to name a few.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/116CUL034

11618	Since its re-organization, MCCOY has established its unique niche       within the community by refraining from direct service programming and       focusing on what it does best: helping to identify youth needs, convening       groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs,       and moving toward collaborative solutions.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/116CUL034

12419	taunting the rest of the press for not following it on the story--and still didn't mention the pardon--it scores an extra two points.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12420	Broaddrick told me Sunday that a Times reporter had appeared at the house in the a.m.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12421	She said, 'Well, I'm sorry I didn't.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12422	The Journal editorial page continues not to acknowledge that Norma Kelsey, the friend and employee to Juanita Broaddrick who is one of two people partially corroborating Broaddrick's rape accusation, is the daughter of a man whose murderer was pardoned by Gov. Bill Clinton.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12423	Chatterbox considered but rejected the idea of awarding Rabinowitz bonus points for having "eventually convinced" Broaddrick to grant an interview to the New York Times (as the Times reports in today's story).	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12424	A responsible account of the whole controversy in today's New York Times reports that Kelsey says the pardon had nothing to do with her corroboration.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12425	Which is what Journal news employees are instructed to say whenever the editorial page causes them cringing embarrassment.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12426	They will then score one point for every subsequent issue or broadcast or Internet posting after the first offense is noted by Chatterbox if they continue not to report said inconvenient fact--and an additional two points on days when the news organization runs a follow-up without making note of said inconvenient fact.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12427	Here's how it works: Publications that refuse to acknowledge (even if to refute the importance of) highly significant but inconvenient facts in their news or opinion coverage of controversial events will score one point for the initial offense.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12428	And besides, Rabinowitz's efforts on the Times ' behalf weren't really unethical, just puzzling, given the two newspapers' intense rivalry.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12429	I told her it would be--certainly as all right as talking to Dunleavy.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12430	With that in mind, Chatterbox hereby inaugurates the Intellectual Dishonesty (henceforth to be known as the Indis ) Index .	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12431	Publications that get all the way up to 20 will be faxed a likeness of Joseph Stalin.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12432	Chatterbox feels certain that the Journal editorial page will provide some follow-up tomorrow to tonight's NBC broadcast of its own Broaddrick interview, which means that if the Journal editorial page continues to take no action it will be in the Indis Hall of Fame by Monday at the latest!	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12433	For the purposes of this survey, the Wall Street Journal will be counted as a separate and distinct publication from the Journal 's editorial page, because, in essence, it is.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12434	Chatterbox would prefer not to invoke the phrase "intellectual dishonesty," because it's pompous and falsely suggests that only intellectuals can be intellectually dishonest.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12435	The Journal editorial page gets one point for failing to note the pardon in its initial Op-Ed by Dorothy Rabinowitz on Feb.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12436	She said Dunleavy caught her by surprise.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12437	Ms.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12438	She said she would if he called again.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12439	When Chatterbox asked the Journal 's DC bureau chief, Alan Murray, who exercised good judgment in not breaking the Broaddrick story (and--full disclosure-- is Chatterbox's former boss), to comment about a Journal employee's feeding sources to the Times , he replied: "I don't really have any comment on what the edit page did.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12440	I asked her why she had decided to talk to the New York Post 's Steve Dunleavy, and refused a Times reporter.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12441	Because it has published three times since the initial omission, it scores an additional three points.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12442	Publications receiving a score of 10 will be inducted into the Indis Hall of Fame .	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12443	Even More "Proving Rape"	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327

12445	and that she had refused an interview," Rabinowitz writes in an e-mail message.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12446	She asked if I thought it would be all right to talk to the Times reporter.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12447	They do their thing, we do ours.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12448	Chatterbox feels that the Wall Street Journal editorial page's coverage of Juanita Broaddrick's rape charges against Bill Clinton (see "Proving Rape ," "More Proving Rape," as well as Michael Kinsley's "Readme"column in the current issue) cries out for the introduction of the Scientific Method into the usually mushy business of assessing press responsibility.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327
12449	That comes to a total of six .	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327

12452	For her part, Rabinowitz explains to Chatterbox that her efforts on behalf of the Times were more indifferent than the Times made them sound.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_327

12454	Hanover's press secretary, Joannie Danielides, said this week that Ms. Hanover had no comment on Mrs. Clinton's potential Senate campaign.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12455	Timothy Noah and Jodi Kantor	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328

12457	Husbands and Wives	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12458	That's almost enough for Chatterbox to jump on the Hillary for Senate bandwagon.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12459	Hanover "would not say whether Giuliani would run for the Senate, whether she would like him to run for Senate, or whether she would campaign for him if he did.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12460	The media conventional wisdom is that Giuliani would make Hillary Clinton's marital problems a major campaign issue.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12461	I think she's dynamic, and I think she's very smart, and she's an amazing speaker,' Ms. Hanover said.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12462	And, for a punch line: "Ms.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328

12464	Does she have any comment on whether Ms. Hanover plans to be Hillary Clinton's campaign manager?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12465	Indis Index                 Update: NBC, in its Juanita Broaddrick broadcast last night, turned up an additional three witnesses who recall being told by Broaddrick in the late 1970s that Bill Clinton raped her.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12466	Giuliani's estrangement from his wife, Donna Hanover, is made clear in an interview with Hanover that appears in today's New York Times .	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12467	One of the three is Kelsey's sister, whose motives can be similarly questioned; the other two heard Broaddrick tell her story but did not see her bruised lip, as only Kelsey and Broaddrick's husband claim to have.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12468	Giuliani makes Ken Starr look like a patsy," cried Time this week.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12469	Many have already opined that the mayor is too vituperative, too much of a loner to practice the congenial, teamwork-oriented politics of the Senate; other doubters have pointed to his hardhearted, uncaring social policies.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12470	But she did say in the interview, which was conducted before the recent frenzy of speculation about Hillary Rodham Clinton's interest in the same New York Senate seat, that Mrs. Clinton is a 'very interesting' person.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12471	However, Chatterbox notes that NBC, like every other responsible news organization that's covered this story, reported that Norma Kelsey's father's killer was pardoned by Gov. Bill Clinton, and remains perplexed that the Journal editorial page won't.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12472	By running against Giuliani (who has been reported in Vanity Fair to have a mistress--he denies it--and, by all accounts, has a sham marriage), the first lady could exact symbolic revenge on her philandering husband while advancing the fortunes of the Democratic party at the same time!	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12473	This diminishes-- slightly-- the significance of Norma Kelsey's possible motives in verifying parts of Broaddrick's story.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328
12474	Chatterbox feels a little dense for not realizing sooner that the subtext (and hence much of the appeal) of a Hillary Clinton-Rudy Giuliani Senate race would be Wronged Wife vs. Neglectful Husband.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_328

12481	That's ironic, since I think it was just that insularity that helped them, much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500
12482	I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be written about this era (probably decades and decades hence as it is too close).	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500
12483	I know what you mean about being a journalist.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500
12484	Much of it, of course, using the standards of top newspapers, cannot be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating, although it certainly could make for some very good stories.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500
12485	As for me, I'll stick with my philosophy of reporting and, I guess, life--nobody knows.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500
12486	Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of businesses where none are allowed to dominate?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500
12487	I often feel as if I only get half the story sometimes, so I typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than I will ever need.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500

12490	Cheers, Kara	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500
12491	But we all know how that story turned out.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500
12492	While I did not attend the trial--I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches, several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing--it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500
12493	I think that is why I welcomed doing a book--it gives one the ability to use so much of what is left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500
12494	Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500
12495	I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company--whether it is AOL or Microsoft or Disney--is in charge of all our destinies: Babylon was.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500

12499	I personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just one man--at AOL, for example, there was a conscious effort to develop other "characters," for lack of a better word.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500
12500	From where I am sitting, I think the Microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_3500

12509	The Wall Street Journal "Outlook" observes, "In the U.S. job market, the balance of power is shifting to employees from employers," and states that "the retention frenzy was triggered in part by previous waves of corporate downsizing," which left behind survivors who took stock of career options and used Internet job listings and intensified recruiting to land better offers, which in turn led to counter-offers and higher salaries.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/Article247_400

13825	Were you born in this area here?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/PolkMaria
13826	Luckily I had all A's.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13827	Naturally, I start crying, and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me, either my stomach, or that I had a headache, or something was wrong with my leg.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13828	Yeah, and at the time, I was also working in the classroom.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13829	And she was in there stomping and crying and mad and taking all her good time.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13830	I'd never gone to college before.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13831	Even though my mom told us lot of scary stories she was always there to hold us in her arms and let us know that the story was not true and that it was we were OK.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13832	But he told me to go ahead and try it, so I took the entrance test, and they accepted me into at the school, and I took some courses there.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13833	And before you know it, the butcher knife came around and cut the little girl's head off.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13834	So she said, "Go home and talk to your mother about it and see if we, you know, can follow through with applying for a grant, scholarship grant for you.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra

13836	I, in later years, I went on to college some but I didn't complete the, uh, whole four years.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13837	So he graduated from, um, Johnson C. Smith, here in Charlotte.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13838	The first school I worked at was Enderly Park and then it was closed down.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13839	Who cares?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13840	At that time my dad was in prison at the time, so it made it really hard for my mom.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13841	If I could just work, even as a teacher assistant I would be happy.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13842	But one day I came in and I looked at my mail and I was accepted.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13843	I learned after I got married          so I was a pretty lazy child when it came down to cleaning up and cooking.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13844	I think that was the last class I took.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13845	I said, "I would love to.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13846	It's always been my dream that my children all go to school.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13847	How many different schools did you teach at?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13848	I guess you'd say as a sub because the teacher that I was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take a leave of absence.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13849	That was my dream, to teach school.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13850	I didn't particularly want to come here and when I came here everybody noticed that I was really, really sad because I loved being at Enderly Park.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13851	And he asked me to be a teacher assistant the next following year.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13852	All of my sisters learned to cook by the age of eight.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13853	So she said, "Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13854	Thank you.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13855	And he told me I would have to write this paper.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13856	I'd like to tell you about how I got into becoming a teacher's assistant.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13857	Just anything to get out of doing my job.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13858	A few years later, um, I had the opportunity to apply for a scholarship to further my education.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13859	I enjoy my job very much.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13860	And I enjoy what I do.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13861	So she began to tell this story.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13862	So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said, "Baby, I really want you to go to college.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13863	During our young years we were very poor.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13864	I don't, just so I can work in the school I'll be happy.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13865	And they hired a sub but the sub didn't do that much.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13866	And why did the other school close down?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13867	So one night my mother asked me to go inside and wash the dishes.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13868	So I never got a chance to go to school.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13869	As I told you, in the past we were a very poor family and I never got the chance to go to college because of this.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13870	Yes, my brother went to school.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13871	Out of 150 assistants who had applied for this grant only 16 got the opportunity, so I felt very proud of myself.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13872	Uh, while I was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that I had an extra bone in my foot and she said, "Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward, on your grant to go to college.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13873	And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up, wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13874	I just got to a certain age and I said, "No I can't do this anymore," so I never went back.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13875	All right thank you.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13876	All of a sudden the butcher knife came out of the drawer and it began to roll around in the air.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13877	I don't want to.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13878	So the little girl just said, "OK I'll go in there and wash the dishes.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13879	After a while, the principal said, "I would like for you to bring me your, um, transcript so I can see what your grades are like.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13880	Now that knife, when I went to sleep it really scared me.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13881	Um, my dream, my prayers were answered.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13882	So they told me about some classes that I could take at Central Piedmont.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13883	I did very well.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13884	I don't feel good.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13885	Um, that, I really don't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything, but they eventually tore it down because I was there I think the first year I went there was the year they built a really nice gym, and I don't think they used that gym no more than three years.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13886	I was really afraid.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13887	I had another sister who went to Gaston College where she got a business degree there.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13888	He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C. Smith, so to make it easier on my mom, to, as far as, you know, him staying at home and going to school too.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13889	So I went on and took the courses, and as I started I think I was taking economics.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13890	Um, I remember once, when I was working in a mill, and I was spinning yarn, and I was saying to myself, and, I was praying actually, and I said, "God, one day I want to work in the school system.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13891	I've only worked at two, two schools.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13892	I couldn't believe it.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13893	I sat there and I cried but I tried to be as understanding as possible because I knew my mother struggled really hard to even keep food on the table for us.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13894	As the years went by my prayer was answered and I got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier and the principal there came up to me and said, "Have you considered being a teacher assistant?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13895	So I was in those situations where I first, come first, transfer last, come first to transfer out.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13896	If I'm not mistaken I think I've been at Berryhill for I think 17 years, 17, 18 years I've been here at Berryhill so and I hope I never have to leave until I retire.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13897	But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13898	And I went to, um, one of my staff members and I asked her if she would proofread it, and she thought it was an excellent paper.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13899	So I worked maybe like four months in the classroom and that highly put a damper on my wanting          to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13900	So I had to, I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill and I chose Berryhill.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13901	My leg hurts, my head hurts.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13902	I can't think of any job that would make me any happier.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13903	And when the little girl went to heaven she was crying down to her dad and saying "Daddy, Daddy!	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13904	Once upon a time there was this little girl and her family.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13905	At first I didn't want to apply for it, but the principal called me during the summer months and said, "Sandra the time is running out, you need to apply.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13906	Well I didn't like writing at the time          but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13907	And her little girl just complained, "I don't want to wash the dishes.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13908	Out of all of my sisters and brothers I was the laziest one of all, as far as working around the house.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13909	So after she noticed that I was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow, do what she tell told me to do, she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13910	I really don't, I don't remember why that school was ever closed but it was.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13911	That's it.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13912	But you would have been able to be a, a teacher if you had continued?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13913	We did not have very much but my mom always found a way to keep us busy or keep us entertained, and one of the ways that she kept us entertained was by telling stories, reading poems, and singing to us.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13914	But then, after awhile, I fell in love with Berryhill.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13915	The little girl disappointed her mother so badly, but her mother said, "How in the world am I ever going to get her to wash these dishes?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13916	Did anybody?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13917	All my life I always wanted to be a teacher even from the time I started to school.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13918	But I love what I do and, uh, anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I go for it so.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13919	My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13920	Now after that, my mother continued to tell us many, many scary stories and tell us many, many, many poems.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13921	After all of this was, after I, I decided not to continue I've never pursued the fact of going back to school.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13922	I had to take over the classroom.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13923	But the wonderful thing about it my mom was always there close by to let me know that I was OK.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13924	One of the stories that I would like to share with you is the story that is pretty scary and it sticks out into my mind, I guess, mostly, mainly because it was scary.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13925	Um, the, you know, I really don't know.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13926	Mama cut my head off with the butcher knife.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13927	And I went ahead and mailed it in thinking uh I won't get the scholarship.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/ReidSandra
13928	And how long have you lived in Charlotte?	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13929	And they were very poor by this point, and they had, I think, seven children.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13930	Oh, I have lived in Charlotte, um, for a year.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13931	Um, I don't know if they were farmers or not, but I know they were land owners, um, many acres and, um, her grandmother was raised in wealth.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13932	We came here in 1986, we lived here for five years, then we moved to Raleigh for seven years and now we've been back one year.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13933	They owned car dealerships and extensive land.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13934	Well, good.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13935	Um, she was raised in MO, and she married a man, this is my grandmother I'm talking about.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13936	Um, I lived in Charlotte for five years.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13937	Um, a little background first.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13938	And although I never met my grandfather, I have never forgotten that story and when I hear of him I think what a wonderful, wonderful person he must have been.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13939	And one particular Christmas, things were very, very difficult.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13940	Um, I felt like that was a way to face that situation with such hope and with joy and with love.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13941	Uh, then the Depression came and apparently everyone lost all their money.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13942	Her, let's see, her mother's family were wealthy people at one time.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13943	There was no money to buy any presents at all, um, for the children, and my grandfather, who was killed when my mother was 16, this was, of course, way before that, um, he must have been a very positive person because what he did with the situation was he, he told the children that there were no presents this Christmas because they had given them all to Santa to take the poor children and this made the children feel happy and proud of themselves and it gave them a good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselves.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie
13944	My name is Bonnie Rindner and I was born in San Antonio, TX, and the story I'm going to tell is about my mother.	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/RindnerBonnie

14089	yeah yeah no i i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then that's fine with me too you know as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in and and i don't like the way that they do it either	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans

14094	have you ever got one of those calls that's either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they're either	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14095	i believe we've pretty much summed everything up	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14096	they're introducing some new product in the area and	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14097	and uh i've read a lot about uh that particular sect and i don't particularly care for it so i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14098	or you hear somebody already starting reading reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans

14101	um-hum	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14102	i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14103	uh pretty close to it well i've enjoyed talking with you	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14104	and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14105	you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door you said something else	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14106	a harassment in itself	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14107	even had some of them the	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14108	and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14109	yeah that's true living in an apartment complex though you know you can't um you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14110	i agree with you on that particular subject there	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14111	okay thanks bye	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans

14114	i put a stop to some of them as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14115	peddling products if i wanted their products i would've either gone to the store to bought it or i would've called for their salesman salesman to come out	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14116	wonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it'd be harassment	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14117	but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14118	but i consider invasion of my privacy	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14119	now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i've even gone so far as to put that i've got a storm door on the front of the house and i've put in	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14120	um-hum	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans

14122	instead of stop	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14123	pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14124	and i don't know i just um i just don't particularly care for that at all and that that's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
14125	and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago	/Users/arzookatiyar/Desktop/TopicModeling/database.mpqa.2.0/docs/ula/sw2015-ms98-a-trans
